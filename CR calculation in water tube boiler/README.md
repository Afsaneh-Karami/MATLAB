## Circulation ratio in water tube boiler:
I wrote this code in Matlab. I used ? article for writing this code. The general idea for this code is that at first estimate a initial value for CR based on the boiler capacity and working pressure and then calculate thermal head and pressure drop in system if they are equal your first estimation of CR would be correct, otherwise you should change it by the step +-.1 to reach a equanvalent among thermal head and pressure drop.
